# Challenge2
The second challenge of the bootcamp

I applied the majority of the commands that we learn and also did some research for some ideas that i had (Make bigger the images when you put the mouse on them and also the gray scales in the avatar/photo)

Since i dont have enough projects I make the Coming Soon part, in order to put the 2 Apps
